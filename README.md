# Stroke Prediction Project

## Overview

This project uses machine learning to predict stroke risk based on patient data. By identifying high-risk individuals, we aim to enable early prevention and reduce the global impact of stroke.

## Dataset

Our model uses the following patient attributes:

- Gender
- Age
- Hypertension status
- Heart disease status
- Marital status
- Work type
- Residence type
- Average glucose level
- BMI
- Smoking status

## Project Goals

1. Develop an accurate stroke prediction model
2. Identify individuals at high risk for stroke
3. Provide a tool for early intervention
4. Contribute to reducing stroke-related mortality

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas for data manipulation
- Scikit-learn for machine learning models
- Streamlit for web application

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required packages: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the Streamlit app: `streamlit run app.py`
4. Input patient data in the web interface
5. Get instant stroke risk prediction

## Model Performance

Our current model achieves:
- Accuracy: 93.8%
- F1 Score: 0.92

## Future Improvements

- Incorporate more diverse datasets
- Experiment with advanced algorithms (e.g., neural networks)
