# Stroke Prediction

This project predicts stroke risk using patient data like age, gender, and health conditions.

## Dataset Details

Each row represents a patient with these attributes:

1. id
2. gender
3. age
4. hypertension
5. heart_disease
6. ever_married
7. work_type
8. Residence_type
9. avg_glucose_level
10. bmi
11. smoking_status
12. stroke

## Why It Matters

Stroke is the second leading cause of death globally (WHO). This project aims to:

1. Identify high-risk individuals
2. Enable early prevention
3. Reduce stroke impact

We'll use data science and machine learning to build an accurate prediction model.
